# Research: Daily Mood Logging Technical Decisions

## Resolved Clarifications

### Note Length Limit
**Decision**: Maximum 500 characters for mood notes  
**Rationale**: Provides sufficient space for meaningful context while preventing database bloat and maintaining UI simplicity  
**Alternatives considered**: No limit (rejected due to UI/UX concerns), 140 characters (rejected as too restrictive)

### Offline Capability Requirements  
**Decision**: Frontend can function offline with local storage, sync when online  
**Rationale**: Mood tracking should not depend on internet connectivity; privacy-first approach aligns with constitutional requirements  
**Alternatives considered**: Always-online (rejected due to privacy/reliability concerns), full offline-only (rejected due to potential data loss)

## Technology Research

### Frontend Architecture
**Decision**: Vanilla JavaScript with Web Components pattern  
**Rationale**: Keeps application simple, fast loading, no external dependencies, constitutional simplicity requirement  
**Alternatives considered**: React (rejected as overkill), Vue (rejected for complexity)

### Backend API Design
**Decision**: RESTful API with Express.js  
**Rationale**: Simple CRUD operations align well with REST, Express provides minimal overhead  
**Alternatives considered**: GraphQL (rejected as unnecessary), FastAPI (rejected due to language constraint)

### Database Schema
**Decision**: SQLite with simple mood_entries table  
**Rationale**: Local storage requirement, no need for complex relationships, file-based portability  
**Alternatives considered**: PostgreSQL (rejected for complexity), JSON files (rejected for query performance)

### Emoji Implementation
**Decision**: Unicode emoji with predefined set (😢😐😊😄😍)  
**Rationale**: Universal support, no image assets needed, constitutionally compliant performance  
**Alternatives considered**: Custom emoji images (rejected for loading time), emoji picker library (rejected for complexity)

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest for unit tests, Supertest for API tests, Playwright for E2E  
**Rationale**: Constitutional >90% coverage requirement, covers all layers, industry standard tools  
**Alternatives considered**: Mocha/Chai (rejected for consistency), Cypress (rejected for resource usage)

## Security & Privacy Research

### Data Encryption
**Decision**: SQLite with SQLCipher extension for encryption at rest  
**Rationale**: Constitutional encryption requirement, local storage security  
**Alternatives considered**: Application-level encryption (rejected for complexity), no encryption (rejected for constitutional compliance)

### Privacy Implementation
**Decision**: No analytics, no external services, local-only data  
**Rationale**: Privacy-by-design constitutional requirement  
**Alternatives considered**: Anonymous analytics (rejected for privacy principle)

## Performance Optimization Research

### Database Indexing
**Decision**: Index on date column for mood_entries table  
**Rationale**: Primary query pattern is by date range, constitutional query performance requirement  
**Alternatives considered**: No indexing (rejected for performance), compound indexes (rejected as unnecessary)

### Frontend Optimization
**Decision**: Service Worker for offline caching, lazy loading for history view  
**Rationale**: Constitutional performance budgets, offline requirement  
**Alternatives considered**: No caching (rejected for performance), full application caching (rejected for data freshness)
