## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to track their emotional wellbeing by logging their daily mood. Each day, they open the application, select an emoji that represents how they feel, optionally add a short note to provide context, and save the entry. This creates a simple record of their emotional patterns over time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user opens the application on any day, **When** they select a mood emoji from the available options, **Then** the emoji is highlighted as selected
2. **Given** the user has selected a mood emoji, **When** they type a short note in the text field, **Then** the note is captured and ready to be saved
3. **Given** the user has selected an emoji and optionally added a note, **When** they tap the save button, **Then** the mood entry is saved with today's date
4. **Given** the user has already logged a mood for today, **When** they try to log another mood, **Then** they can update their existing entry for the day
5. **Given** the user opens the application, **When** they want to see their previous mood entries, **Then** they can view a simple list or calendar of past entries

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user tries to save without selecting an emoji?
- How does the system handle very long notes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: note length limit not specified]?
- What happens if the user opens the app multiple times in one day?
- How does the system behave when there's no internet connection [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: offline capability requirements unclear]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to select a mood emoji from a predefined set of emotional states
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to enter an optional short text note to accompany their mood entry
- **FR-003**: System MUST save mood entries with the current date automatically
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow only one mood entry per day per user
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to update their mood entry for the current day
- **FR-006**: System MUST display previously logged mood entries to users
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent saving a mood entry without selecting an emoji
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist mood data between application sessions
- **FR-009**: System MUST display today's date when creating a new entry

### Non-Functional Requirements *(include for constitution compliance)*
- **NFR-001**: Performance: Mood entry saving MUST complete within 100ms as per constitutional budget
- **NFR-002**: User Experience: Interface MUST be simple and intuitive, following established design patterns
- **NFR-003**: Testing: Feature MUST have >90% test coverage with unit, integration, and performance tests
- **NFR-004**: Security: User mood data MUST be stored securely with privacy-by-design principles
- **NFR-005**: Code Quality: Implementation MUST pass linting, formatting, and complexity checks
- **NFR-006**: Accessibility: Interface MUST support screen readers and basic accessibility standards

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MoodEntry**: Represents a single daily mood log containing an emoji identifier, optional text note, and the date of entry. Each user can have one mood entry per calendar day.
